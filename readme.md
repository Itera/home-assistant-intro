# home-assistant-intro
If you have make installed (there's a decent chance if you're on Mac OS or Linux) simply run 
```make```
in this directory to get started. Make sure you have docker installed and that your user is in the docker group (`sudo adduser $USER docker` and log out and back in to the machine) 

For Windows users have a look at the content of the Makefile and run docker commands manually. They should be somewhat self explanetory.
